## General Information

- Developing a multiple Linear Regression model i.e one target variable and many independent variables.
- BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people and they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market.  
- Bike dataset is being used

## Conclusions
- Temp, year and humidity are the top 3 predictors t increase the demand.
- The test and the training set have worked well.
